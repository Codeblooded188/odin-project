    <p><b>Description</b></p>
    Banku is a traditional Ghanaian dish known for its hearty and satisfying nature. It's made from a mixture of fermented corn and cassava dough, resulting in a dense, smooth, and stretchy consistency. The dough is cooked by stirring it into boiling water until it thickens. Banku is often served with a variety of soups and stews, such as light soup, groundnut soup, or okra soup. The dish is typically enjoyed by tearing off a small piece of banku, shaping it into a scoop, and using it to pick up flavorful bites of the accompanying soup or stew, creating a delightful and culturally rich dining experience.
